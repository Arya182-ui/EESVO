# Security Policy

At **EESVO**, security is a top priority. We are committed to keeping the platform secure and protecting user data. Below is our security policy, which details the supported versions of our project and the process for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We maintain the following versions of the **EESVO** project with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

- **Active Maintenance**: Security updates are actively provided for the current version (5.1.x) and the previous major version (4.0.x).
- **Deprecated Versions**: Versions older than 4.0.x are no longer supported with security updates and should be upgraded to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **EESVO**, please report it responsibly by following the steps below:

### Steps to Report a Vulnerability:
1. **Submit an Issue on GitHub**: Open a new issue in the repository and label it as **Security Vulnerability**. Ensure that you provide as much detail as possible, including:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
   - Impact assessment (e.g., can it lead to data leakage, remote code execution, etc.)

   Alternatively, if you prefer to keep the details private, you can email the security team at [security@eesvo.com](mailto:security@eesvo.com).

2. **Security Response Timeline**: After submitting a vulnerability report, we aim to respond within **48 hours** to acknowledge receipt of your report.
   
3. **Acknowledgement and Updates**:
   - If your vulnerability report is accepted, we will prioritize addressing the issue and provide a fix or a workaround.
   - We will release security patches for the vulnerability as soon as possible and notify users of the update.

4. **Public Disclosure**: Once a fix has been deployed, the vulnerability will be disclosed publicly in the **EESVO** changelog and on the GitHub repository, with full credit to the reporter.

### What to Expect:
- We will review your report and provide an initial response within **48 hours**.
- If we confirm the issue as a security vulnerability, we will work on a fix, perform any necessary tests, and release a patch as part of the next update.
- We will disclose the issue in a responsible manner, typically after a patch has been released to prevent potential exploitation of the vulnerability.

### Best Practices:
- **Security Focus**: Please ensure that reports focus on potential security flaws that could expose sensitive data or compromise the platform's integrity.
- **Code of Conduct**: We ask that all contributors and reporters follow ethical guidelines and avoid exploiting security issues before they are patched.

## Acknowledgements

We appreciate the efforts of the security community for helping us keep **EESVO** secure. Thank you for taking the time to report any issues and working with us to improve the platform.
